# self-driving-decision-system
Self-driving vehicles needs two capacities: 1) interacting with surrounding traffic participants in local custom and meanwhile 2) driving safely, efficiently, comfortably and  environmentally. The project provides a method to learn the local custom and optimize the performance of the self-driving vehicle. To limit the scale of the driving problem, the project assumes the perception of traffic environment is available and accurate. That is to say, the types and states of traffic participants, road structures and all of other necessary elements can be detected.
